**Godot 4.0 has been released!**<br>
Godot 4.0 is the latest stable release version of the engine.<br>
There is a limited amount of learning material available, so if you're looking to make a game or learn the engine, we recommend you stick with 3.x for now. Don't worry - what you learn will still apply when you're ready to move to the newer version!<br>
This site has lots of learning material for Godot 3 - but not all of it has been updated for version 4 yet. You can click the ribbon in the top-right to toggle the Godot Recipes version, or click the button below:<br>

### How to use this site

#### Beginners

If you're new to game development, start with the ["Godot 101: Basics"](/godot_recipes/3.x/basics/) section. There you'll find an introduction to the Godot application, and a step-by-step guide to creating your first project. There is a lot of material to absorb here. Don't feel discouraged if you feel you don't get it at first. Repetition is the key to learning complex topics; the more you work with Godot's features, the more familiar and _easy_ they will start to feel.
