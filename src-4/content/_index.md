### How to use this site

#### Beginners

If you're new to game development, start with the ["Godot 101: Basics"](/godot_recipes/4.x/basics/) section. There you'll find an introduction to the Godot application, and a step-by-step guide to creating your first project. There is a lot of material to absorb here. Don't feel discouraged if you feel you don't get it at first. Repetition is the key to learning complex topics; the more you work with Godot's features, the more familiar and _easy_ they will start to feel.
