Solution For our example, we&amp;rsquo;ll use the Isometric Mini-Crusader, which contains 8-directional animations for idle, run, attack, and several other states.
The animations are organized in folders, with a separate image for each frame. We&amp;rsquo;ll use an AnimatedSprite and we&amp;rsquo;ll name each animation based on its direction. For example, idle0 pointing to the right and going clockwise to idle7.</description></item></channel></rss>
