Your player&amp;rsquo;s score, for example, needs to be accessed by various game objects (to increase it) and by the HUD (to display it). Furthermore, if you&amp;rsquo;re changing scenes using change_scene(), you don&amp;rsquo;t want that data to be lost when the old scene is freed.
Solution To solve this problem, Godot provides the concept of an Autoload. This is a scene (or script) that you want the engine to automatically load at runtime.</description></item><item><title>Inheritance</title><link>http://godotrecipes.com/3.x/recipes/godot3_inheritance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2018 15:12:12 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://godotrecipes.com/3.x/recipes/godot3_inheritance/</guid><description>In this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how inheritance works in Godot. You can use inheritance in Godot to reuse code and create powerful hierarchies of object and scenes in your game.
We&amp;rsquo;ll imagine we&amp;rsquo;re making a classic top-down RPG and use Godot&amp;rsquo;s inheritance capabilities to create two different kinds of characters in the game.
Introduction In object oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a powerful tool. Put briefly, you can define a class that inherits from another class.</description></item></channel></rss>
