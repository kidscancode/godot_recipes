Solution The first step in getting an enemy to chase the player is to determine what direction the enemy needs to move. To get the vector pointing from A to B, you subtract: B - A. Normalize the result and you have a direction vector.
This makes the solution quite straightforward. Every frame, set the enemy&amp;rsquo;s velocity to point in the direction of the player.</description></item><item><title>Path following</title><link>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3.x/ai/path_follow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3.x/ai/path_follow/</guid><description>Problem You want a character to follow a pre-defined path, such as a guard patrolling or a car following the road.
Solution There are many ways to approach this problem. In this solution, we&amp;rsquo;ll use Godot&amp;rsquo;s Path2D node (or Path for 3D) as a convenient way to draw paths in the editor.
You can add the Path2D as a child of your main scene, your map, or another location that makes sense.</description></item><item><title>Changing behaviors</title><link>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3.x/ai/changing_behaviors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3.x/ai/changing_behaviors/</guid><description>Problem You want your AI-controlled entity to switch between different behaviors.
Solution For this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll assume an enemy with the following behaviors. See the individual recipes for how to make each behavior work.
Patrol
The &amp;ldquo;Patrol&amp;rdquo; state moves along a pre-defined path (or stands still if there&amp;rsquo;s no path assigned). See Recipe: Path following for details.
Chase
The &amp;ldquo;Chase&amp;rdquo; state moves the enemy towards the player. See Recipe: Chasing the player for how to make this behavior.</description></item><item><title>Homing missile</title><link>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3.x/ai/homing_missile/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3.x/ai/homing_missile/</guid><description>Problem You need a &amp;ldquo;homing missile&amp;rdquo; - a projectile that will seek a moving target.
Solution For this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll use an Area2D node for the projectile. Areas are typically good choices for bullets because we need to detect when they contact something. If you also need a bullet that bounces/ricochets, one of the PhysicsBody type node might be a better choice.
The node setup and behavior of the missile is the same you would use for a &amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; bullet.</description></item><item><title>Context-based steering</title><link>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3.x/ai/context_map/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3.x/ai/context_map/</guid><description>Problem You need an AI-controlled object in your game that can follow a path, avoid obstacles, and make other decisions about how to move around the world.
Solution &amp;ldquo;Steering behavior&amp;rdquo; is the blanket term for a variety of algorithms that you can use to solve this problem. Which one you choose will depend on your game, the type of world the object lives in, and what type of &amp;ldquo;intelligence&amp;rdquo; you want it to have.</description></item></channel></rss>
